# Brandon Haskell
**Aspiring Software Developer | Passionate Tech Enthusiast | Committed Collaborator**

Emerging software developer with a strong affinity for technology and unique perspectives from diverse work experiences. Eager to expand my network of engineers and rapidly grow within the industry.

After a brief hiatus to care for a family member, I'm excited to re-enter the workforce as a dedicated Web Developer. If you're aware of any opportunities for a fast learner, skilled communicator, and collaborative team player, kindly share my profile.

I'm always open to offering help, guidance, or simply engaging in a friendly conversation. Don't hesitate to reach out, even for a coffee (or tea) chat. Looking forward to connecting with you!
